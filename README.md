# Learning how to use Github :)

Some info...

Git CRASH COURSE:

TERMS:
- directory : folder
- CLI : Command line interface
- cd : change directory
- Repository : project, or the folder/place where your project is kept
- GitHub : A website to host your repositories online

GIT COMMANDS:
- clone : bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like GitHub into a folder on your local machine
- add : track your files and changes in Git
- commit : save your files in Git
- push : upload Git commits to a remote repo (short for repository), like GitHub
- pull : download changes from remote repo to your local machine, the opposite of push

Note: when crating a new file, if we use the termination : README.md, the .md is for formatting the fila as a mark down file, where we can write whatever we want.
In this case a README file is just a file where it is explained how the code works and what it does.
